# Weekly AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to summarize AI news articles into markdown, following specific guidelines. First, I need to parse each article's content, date, and URL. The user provided a bunch of articles with dates in GMT, but they want the date in IST. So I need to convert GMT to IST for each date. IST is GMT+5:30, so I'll add 5 hours and 30 minutes to each GMT date.

Looking at the first article: Date is Mon, 14 Jul 2025 14:30:00 GMT. Adding 5h30m gives 14:30 + 5:30 = 20:00 IST, so the date becomes 2025-07-14. The summary should be a concise sentence. The content mentions TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 Audience Choice winners, so the summary would be about announcing the winners.

Next article: URL is about Meta acquiring Play AI. Date is Sun, 13 Jul 2025 21:32:25 GMT. Convert to IST: 21:32 +5:30 = 03:02 next day, so date is 2025-07-14. Summary: Meta acquires voice startup Play AI to generate human-sounding voices.

Third article: OpenAI delays open model. Date is Sat, 12 Jul 2025 01:38:05 GMT. IST: 01:38 +5:30 = 07:08, so date 2025-07-12. Summary: OpenAI delays open model release again, pushing back to compete with GPT-5 launch.

Fourth article: Meta's 5GW AI data center. Date is Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:16:52 GMT. IST: 16:16 +5:30 = 21:46, date 2025-07-14. Summary: Meta builds Hyperion data center with 5GW computational power for AI.

Fifth article: Malaysia's AI chip export restrictions. Date Mon, 14 Jul 2025 17:37:50 GMT. IST 17:37 +5:30 = 23:07, date 2025-07-14. Summary: Malaysia requires trade permits for US AI chips to prevent smuggling to China.

Sixth article: Meta's crackdown on unoriginal content. Date Mon, 14 Jul 2025 20:30:01 GMT. IST 20:30 +5:30 = 02:00 next day, date 2025-07-15. Summary: Meta cracks down on unoriginal Facebook content, following YouTube's policy.

Seventh article: Nvidia resuming China chip sales. Date Tue, 15 Jul 2025 04:36:47 GMT. IST 04:36 +5:30 = 10:06, date 2025-07-15. Summary: Nvidia files to resume H20 AI chip sales to China after regulatory changes.

Eighth article: SpaceX investing in xAI. Date Sun, 13 Jul 2025 15:12:17 GMT. IST 15:12 +5:30 = 20:42, date 2025-07-13. Summary: SpaceX to invest $2B in Elon Musk's xAI.

Ninth article: UN AI refugee avatar. Date Sat, 12 Jul 2025 21:03:39 GMT. IST 21:03 +5:30 = 02:33 next day, date 2025-07-13. Summary: UN creates AI avatars of Sudanese refugee and soldier for policy research.

Tenth article: Grok AI companions. Date Mon, 14 Jul 2025 18:36:27 GMT. IST 18:36 +5:30 = 24:06, date 2025-07-14. Summary: Elon Musk's Grok offers paid AI companions, including a goth anime girl.

Eleventh article: Goldman Sachs testing AI agent. Date Fri, 11 Jul 2025 17:59:17 GMT. IST 17:59 +5:30 = 23:29, date 2025-07-11. Summary: Goldman Sachs tests Cognition's AI coding agent Devin as a new employee.

Twelfth article: OpenAI's acquisition of Windsurf fails. Date Fri, 11 Jul 2025 22:21:51 GMT. IST 22:21 +5:30 = 03:51 next day, date 2025-07-12. Summary: OpenAI's $3B acquisition of Windsurf collapses; Google acquires key talent.

Thirteenth article: Marc Andreessen's DEI criticism. Date Sat, 12 Jul 2025 20:07:29 GMT. IST 20:07 +5:30 = 01:37 next day, date 2025-07-13. Summary: Marc Andreessen criticizes universities for DEI policies in group chat.

Fourteenth article: Meta shifting to closed AI models. Date Mon, 14 Jul 2025 22:44:24 GMT. IST 22:44 +5:30 = 04:14 next day, date 2025-07-15. Summary: Meta's Superintelligence Lab may pivot from open-source to closed AI models.

Fifteenth article: VentureBeat article on hiring AI-native engineers. Date Sun, 13 Jul 2025 18:15:00 GMT. IST 18:15 +5:30 = 23:45, date 2025-07-14. Summary: Emphasize AI fluency over traditional coding skills in hiring.

Now, I need to sort all these by date in IST, latest first. The latest date is 2025-07-15 (Meta crackdown, Nvidia, UN, Meta's Superintelligence, VentureBeat). Then 2025-07-14 (TechCrunch Disrupt, Meta data center, Malaysia, Grok, Meta open vs closed, VentureBeat). Next 2025-07-13 (Meta Play AI, SpaceX), then 2025-07-12 (OpenAI delay, Windsurf, UN). Then earlier dates.

Wait, checking the dates again. The articles have dates from 11th to 15th. The order should be:

July 15, 14, 13, 12, 11.

So the latest first. Now arrange each summary under the correct date in markdown format as specified. Ensure the date is **YYYY-MM-DD** and each entry is a bullet point with the summary and URL link. Double-check the date conversions and that each summary is concise. Make sure to sort correctly.
